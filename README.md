# React Portfolio

## Description

Here I used my React skills to build a single page application to share some information about me! When you open the application you will be directed to the "About Me" Page where you can see a photo of me plus a short bio. From navbar you can select "Portfolio" to see my previous projects, "Contact Me" to leave me a message, and "Resume" to either see or download my job history and education. I also linked my GitHub, Linkedin, and Facebook accounts on the bottom of the page so you can easily take a look at my profiles.
